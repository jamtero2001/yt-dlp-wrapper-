# Cat Image Setup Instructions

## Your New App Design 🐱

Your YT-DLP Wrapper has been completely redesigned with a **minimalist, cat-themed interface**!

## What Changed:

### 🎨 **New Layout:**
- **Center Stage**: Large cat image (your cute cats with YouTube buttons) as the main focus
- **Bottom Input**: Clean URL input with "Download" and "Show Log" buttons
- **Hidden Log**: Log section is hidden by default but toggleable for debugging
- **No Video Preview**: Removed the WebView2 player for a cleaner, faster experience

### 🎯 **Simplified Workflow:**
1. **Paste URL** → Enter any video URL in the bottom input
2. **Click Download** → App analyzes the video and shows quality options
3. **Choose Quality** → Select your preferred quality and download
4. **Optional**: Click "Show Log" to see what's happening behind the scenes

## 🖼️ **To Add Your Cat Image:**

1. **Save your cat image** (the one with cats and YouTube play buttons) as `center-cats.png`
2. **Place it** in your project root folder: `C:\Users\agust\Desktop\yt-dlp\center-cats.png`
3. **Run the app**: `dotnet run`

## 🎉 **Features:**
- ✅ Clean, professional vanilla styling (no more dark theme)
- ✅ Your cute cat image as the centerpiece
- ✅ URL input with built-in watermark text
- ✅ Log section hidden by default (toggle with "Show Log")
- ✅ All original download functionality preserved
- ✅ Responsive design that scales with window size

## 🐾 **Perfect for:**
- Cat lovers who want a fun, clean video downloader
- Users who prefer minimal, distraction-free interfaces
- Anyone who wants the power of yt-dlp with a cute UI

**Enjoy your new cat-themed video downloader!** 🎬🐱
